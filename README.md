# DeepSeek V4 for Copilot Chat

Use DeepSeek V4 (Pro / Flash / Flash Vision) as a native model in VS Code Copilot Chat — extended thinking, agent-mode tool calling, image input, and your real DeepSeek bill in the status bar.

## Quick start

You need VS Code 1.106+, the **GitHub Copilot Chat** extension signed in (this extension only adds models to its picker), and a DeepSeek account with API balance.

1. Install **DeepSeek V4 for Copilot Chat** from the VS Code Marketplace.
2. Command Palette → `Manage DeepSeek V4 Provider` → paste your [DeepSeek API key](https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys).
3. In Copilot Chat, open the model picker and choose a DeepSeek V4 variant. If none are listed, use the picker's **Manage Models…** entry and enable DeepSeek V4.

## Models

| Picker entry | API model | Thinking | Images | Input budget | Output budget |
| ------ | ------ | :---: | :---: | ------ | ------ |
| DeepSeek V4 Pro (thinking) | `deepseek-v4-pro` | ✓ | — | 640K | 384K |
| DeepSeek V4 Pro | `deepseek-v4-pro` | — | — | 960K | 64K |
| DeepSeek V4 Flash (thinking) | `deepseek-v4-flash` | ✓ | — | 640K | 384K |
| DeepSeek V4 Flash | `deepseek-v4-flash` | — | — | 960K | 64K |
| DeepSeek V4 Flash Vision (thinking) | `deepseek-v4-flash-vision-exp` | ✓ | ✓ | 640K | 384K |
| DeepSeek V4 Flash Vision | `deepseek-v4-flash-vision-exp` | — | ✓ | 960K | 64K |

**(thinking)** variants reason in a hidden chain of thought before answering — slower and more tokens, but stronger on hard and agentic tasks; the plain variants answer directly. All variants share DeepSeek V4's 1M-token context (input + output); thinking variants reserve 384K for output so long reasoning chains are never truncated.

## What you get

- Extended thinking with selectable depth (`high` / `max`), and the reasoning chain carried across multi-turn agent loops
- Agent-mode tool calling across long multi-turn loops — tool results and the model's own reasoning are carried from turn to turn
- Native image input on the Vision variants
- Live account balance in the status bar (CNY / USD auto-detected); the hover adds session spend
- Context-window usage in Copilot Chat's native indicator (needs VS Code 1.120+)
- Actionable error messages (400 / 401 / 402 / 422 / 429) and automatic retry on transient failures
- A first-run walkthrough; without a key the picker entries show a warning instead of disappearing

## Images (Vision variants)

Pick a **Flash Vision** variant and attach images in Copilot Chat; thinking and tool calling work exactly as on Flash.

- Formats: JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP. Anything else — and any image sent to a text-only variant — is dropped, never paraphrased by another model.
- Limits: 48 MiB per request (base64 counts) and 32 MiB per image, both checked locally before sending.
- Cost: up to 384 tokens per image, billed at Flash prices.
- `-exp` is experimental on DeepSeek's side ([release note, 2026-08-21](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/news/news260821/)); expect rough edges.

## Why a native provider?

Two things a generic OpenAI-compatible bridge cannot do for DeepSeek V4:

- **Reasoning round-trip.** DeepSeek's thinking mode expects each prior assistant turn's `reasoning_content` back on the next request — a hard 400 without it until a 2026-08-22 live check found the server lenient (the docs still define the rule) — and VS Code's chat history has no field for it. This extension caches it locally and re-attaches it on every request, so the model keeps its own chain of thought across agent turns and every request stays byte-identical to what DeepSeek already cached, keeping the discounted cache-hit input price.
- **Real cost, not estimates.** Balance and session spend come from DeepSeek's `/user/balance`; cache-hit / miss tokens come from the real `usage` data.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| `Manage DeepSeek V4 Provider` | Set or update your API key |
| `Refresh DeepSeek V4 Balance` | Fetch the latest account balance |
| `Show DeepSeek V4 Log` | Open the runtime log channel |
| `Show DeepSeek V4 Reasoning Cache Stats` | Reasoning-cache diagnostics |
| `Clear DeepSeek V4 Reasoning Cache` | Purge cached `reasoning_content` (e.g. before sharing a log) |
| `Clear DeepSeek V4 Session Counter` | Reset the session spend display |
| `Compact Copilot Chat` | Run Copilot Chat's `/compact` when context is near the cap |

## Settings

| Setting | Values | Default | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| `deepseekv4.reasoningEffort` | `high` \| `max` | `max` | Reasoning depth for the `(thinking)` variants; ignored by the others. `high` is faster with shorter chains. Applies to the next message. |
| `deepseekv4.logRawReasoning` | `boolean` | `false` | Stream raw `reasoning_content` to the log (only useful when debugging cache breakdowns). May capture private code — keep **off** when sharing logs. |

## Billing & the Copilot premium-request quota

Every request goes to `api.deepseek.com` with **your** key and bills your prepaid DeepSeek balance (pay-as-you-go — see [DeepSeek pricing](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/quick_start/pricing)), never your Copilot quota.

Since 2026-08-16 the rate also depends on **when** you send the request — DeepSeek bills peak and off-peak differently, and off-peak is half price. The extension deliberately does **not** encode those windows; they are vendor policy and have already changed once. Read the current schedule on the pricing page linked above. What the status bar shows is the one thing that cannot go stale: your real balance, straight from `/user/balance`.

One exception comes from Copilot Chat itself: in **agent mode** it can spawn **sub-agents** (the `agent` / `runSubagent` tool — notably the Explore Agent) on a Copilot-hosted model regardless of the model you picked, and those calls *do* consume premium requests. This affects every bring-your-own-key (BYOK) provider ([community#197840](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/197840), [#16](https://github.com/Laurent00TT/deepseek-v4-vscode-chat/issues/16)). To avoid it:

1. In agent mode, open the tools picker (the **Configure Tools** icon in the chat input) and **uncheck `agent` / `runSubagent`** — most reliable.
2. Or set `github.copilot.chat.exploreAgent.model` to a DeepSeek V4 model.
3. Or use Ask mode for turns that don't need tools.

## FAQ

**`Cannot have more than 128 tools per request` (sometimes wrapped in a 502).**
DeepSeek accepts at most 128 tools. The provider keeps the first 128 usable tools in Copilot's order and warns when the rest are omitted, rather than failing the chat. Omitted tools are unavailable for that request: use Copilot Chat's **Configure Tools** picker to disable unneeded tools or MCP servers so the tools you need fit within the limit.

**`The reasoning_content in the thinking mode must be passed back to the API` (400).**
Not seen since a 2026-08-22 live check (the API accepted every history shape without reasoning), but the docs still define the rule. If it appears, some assistant turn has no cached reasoning (pre-extension history, a cleared cache, or eviction in a very long session): start a new chat; *Show DeepSeek V4 Reasoning Cache Stats* diagnoses.

**"prompt cache hit rate dropped" warning.**
Your conversation's cached prefix on DeepSeek's side broke, so further turns bill at the full (cache-miss) input price instead of the discounted cache-hit price. The extension cannot tell why — a turn cancelled or failed mid-stream, eviction in a very long session, or an editor restart are all possible. *Start New Chat* cuts losses; *Show Cache Stats* diagnoses. Background: [#19](https://github.com/Laurent00TT/deepseek-v4-vscode-chat/issues/19).

**Copilot's context indicator shows 0 / 0%.**
Update to VS Code **1.120+** — earlier hosts don't display usage for extension-provided models ([#18](https://github.com/Laurent00TT/deepseek-v4-vscode-chat/issues/18), [microsoft/vscode#315394](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/315394)).

**My image attachment is ignored.**
Only the Flash Vision variants send images. Check the format and the 48 MiB / 32 MiB limits above.

**No OpenRouter / custom base URL?**
Deliberate ([#4](https://github.com/Laurent00TT/deepseek-v4-vscode-chat/issues/4)): OpenRouter reshapes DeepSeek's thinking protocol (`reasoning_details` instead of `reasoning_content`, a different thinking switch, no cache-hit accounting) — exactly what this extension depends on. For OpenRouter use a dedicated provider such as [ostash/openrouter-chat-provider](https://github.com/ostash/openrouter-chat-provider).

## Privacy

- **No telemetry.** The only network peer is `api.deepseek.com`; images go only there.
- Your API key lives in VS Code **SecretStorage** (OS keychain), never in settings files.
- The reasoning cache is stored on disk (it survives VS Code restarts) and can hold fragments of your code and prompts; *Clear DeepSeek V4 Reasoning Cache* purges it, and `deepseekv4.logRawReasoning` is off by default.
